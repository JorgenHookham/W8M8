# W8M8

Workout companion app built with:

- `expo`
- `react-native`
- `react-navigation`
- `redux`
- `redux-thunk`


## Local Development

1. Clone the repository -> `npm i` -> `npm start`.
2. Install Expo app on your test device.
3. Read QR code with your test device (Tunnel works for me, LAN doesn't)
